Hello, my name is Jeffrey Gomez. My email is jgomez18@my.waketech.edu
I don't know how to describe these things briefly. This is my Github account. My username is Jgomez-18
I was able to create a repository in Git Hub.
I made a repository clone onto my machine by opening the desktop version, choosing "create a clone," and selecting the file I wanted to clone.

Hello, my name is Jeffrey Gomez. My email is jgomez18@my.waketech.edu
Im not really sure how im supposed to give a brief description of any of these things. This is my Github account, my username is Jgomez-18
I was able to create a repository in github.
I made a repository clone onto my machine by opening the desktop version and choosing create a clone, and chose the file i wanted to clone.
